              <h1>The step by step guide to compose your ideal  narrative essay</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="order-form-wrap">
            <p>You went to that fantastic unknown place for a holiday and you have gotten an  opportunity to write about it. To ensure that others can take in your  excitement and be amazed at you as a narrator the following ideas should be  kept in mind:</p>
      <p><strong>A brief outline of the experience</strong></p>
      <p>While we know that you can’t wait to reveal  the full details of your encounter with someone famous or even your swimming  course tell your readers first in brief what you are writing. They need to come  to board with you before you flesh out the details. A proper reeling device has  to be used by you, the narrator. A short pitch works wonders.</p>
        <p><strong>The essay structure </strong></p>
        <p>By  convention the essay should be five paragraphs long. There can occasionally be  an extra paragraph added if the experience needs further elaboration. </p>
      <ul class="bull">
        <li>In the first paragraph as mentioned  earlier there should be a synopsis of the events. </li>
        <li>The next three to four paragraphs  require detailed descriptions of the event. These are the breaking down  sections of the narrative. </li>
        <li>In the last paragraph there has to be a  rounding up of these elements. Final thoughts are meant for the concluding  text.</li>
      </ul>
            <p><strong>The  writing tone</strong></p>
            <p>It is imperative to keep the tone as personal as  possible. There are some essay writers who use the second person or the third  person during their custom writing. However the use of the first person  narrative ensures a rapport with the readers or browsers. Attention does not  get deflected then. There should ideally not be an incorporation of a first  person narrative and a second person narrative or a third person narrative.  This is often a bottleneck for the reader and he or she may not bother to face  further agonies. The reader’s sanctity should be respected.</p>
      
      
      
      <p><strong>The  use of real life details in a narrative format</strong></p>
            <p>The narrative device is often associated with  fiction. Yet in the case of a narrative essay a real life experience occupies  the central stage. Questions about mixing fiction and non-fiction come into  play. You do not have to resort to exaggeration while talking about the  experience or event. What matters most is the description of these events.  Plain ordinary daily occurrences can be transformed into enthralling narratives.  A primary appeal is the realism on show.</p>
       <p><strong>Whether the present tense or the past tense should be employed</strong></p>
       <p>It is worth pondering for a minute about the tense  that you will deploy in your essay. In different narrative essays either the  present or the past tense can work. One advantage for the usage of the present  tense is that a sense of immediacy can be conveyed by the essay writer. This is  usually more attractive for the reader. However there can be paper writings of  past events that are unlikely to take place again with regard to the general  public. In this scenario the past tense would be suitable.</p>
       <p><strong>How  agreeable you should be with regard to conventional points of view</strong></p>
       <p>A narrative essay is an ideal medium for laying out  the writer's take on what is happening, in a perhaps unique fashion, in his or  her life. In the process he or she will reveal what is special about it.  Subjectivity will inevitably creep in. A difference of points of view between  the writer and the readers takes place often through the narrative. The  question though is whether there can be a minor point of discordance or a major  irrevocable divergence.</p>
