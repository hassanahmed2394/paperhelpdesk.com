              <h1>Get ready to write the best reflective essay  ever</h1>

              <p>We reflect all throughout the day. That is a  fundamental part of human existence. So it makes sense to find a medium of  expression for particularly significant thoughts and experiences. There is a  method that you can follow to write the reflective essay that you would love  for people to read. Some of the ways of doing so are:</p>
        <p><strong>Be emotionally honest to get to the  crucial experiences</strong></p>
        <p>We often tell ourselves that what we experience often is special. However  if we introspect on our lives then certain past events will stand out. They  will do so for how they made us feel then .More significantly for essay writers  will be how those events manage to evoke emotions even now. A lifelong impact  post the experience needs to be showcased in the paper writing. A healthy  knowledge of yourself-what makes you tick and what angers you- is vital in this  process.</p>
        <p><strong>The reflective essay and its basic  elements </strong></p>
        <p>All that you want to write down in your essay has to be summed up in five  paragraphs.</p>
        <ul class="bull">
        <li>The experience or the event has to be  described in brief in the opening paragraph. Much as you would like to describe  sensations and thoughts from the get go there needs to be an anchoring point  for the reader. Giving an outline description of the event is necessary to get the  reader along.</li>
        <li>Feelings and possible actions undertaken  during the course of the event have to be relayed in the following four  paragraphs. There needs to be a sense of transporting the reader by your side  as you give a minute representation of the event. </li>
        <li>In the last paragraph there should be a decisive  statement on how the event has shaped you. You have to give the reader a  glimpse of your changed mindset.<br />
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Be  comfortable writing about yourself </strong></p>
        <p>It  is usually easier to talk about others rather than oneself. Sleight of  judgement can be cast with a practiced dexterity as it is done throughout oneâ€™s  life. What is troublesome is the opinions that we share about ourselves.</p>
        
        <p> Most persons assume  that when you are writing about yourself self-glorification would be key.  However the conscious exhibition of flaws and self-awareness are more effective  literary tools. Reflective essays do not lend themselves to the promotion of an  agenda or a peacock like display of virtues.</p>
            <p>There has to be an  introspection process showcased-and what is important to remember is that not  all experiences lead to happy endings. Reflective essays can lead to  realization of pain and anger due to the said event. One has to register those so  called negative feelings too in the paper writing exercise.</p>
      <p><strong>Consult  others who were a part of your experience</strong></p>
            <p>While looking back we  tend to look at others as static points through which we thread our thoughts.  However in the description of the event and the experience you should talk to  other participants. The most important reason to do so would be to establish a  frame of reference by which your thoughts gain luminosity. Details of other  persons can also emerge as a needed break for the reader. In reflective  writing, details may be used in a lesser number than in other forms of custom  writing but that does not diminish their significance.</p>
      <p> <strong>Make the most of revising the essay</strong></p>
      <p>Ultimately you will submit an essay that will be a conflation of the event,  your experience of it and your written expression of it. In doing so there are  likely to be errors in what one writes and what one intended to convey.  Multiple revisions are often necessary to make the paper writing as error free  as possible. Grammar and spelling mistakes have to be weeded out. If necessary  a new point may need to be installed at the cost of another point.</p>
