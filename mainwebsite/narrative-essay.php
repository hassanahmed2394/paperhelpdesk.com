              <h1>The ultimate cheat guide to writing  descriptive essays</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="order-form-wrap">
               <p> The best aspect about a descriptive essay is that any event under the sun falls  into its domain. So a wide rope is given to the college student to make the  most of. However to ensure that he or she doesn’t trip in the process some  measures should be adapted by the student:</p>
        <p><strong>Taking  time out to decide on the topic</strong></p>
        <p>It  is one of those remarkable events in life for college students. They have the  luxury of choices when it comes to writing descriptive essays. However not all topics  will be college essay material. You will have to narrow down your choices to a  topic you can see yourself writing even an hour later. It should ideally also  be something that you see yourself talking about in the near future. Reader  interest is a much talked about topic but so should be writer interest.</p>
        <p><strong>The  structure of the descriptive essay</strong></p>
        <p>Five  paragraphs are how the descriptive essay should be arranged.</p>
        <p>In the first paragraph tell the reader what topic you’ve chosen to elaborate on.</p>
        <p>In the next three paragraphs you have to go deep  about the topic. Talk about the personal experience .Use references that are in  vogue to embellish your paper writing.</p>
        <p>In the last paragraph write on how the topic affects you. How others can be  inspired or affected should also be reflected in the end.</p>
        <p><strong>The  importance of staying focused on topic</strong></p>
        <p>You cannot deviate too much from the main topic.  Some references, allusions and examples are necessary and welcome. But at the  same time what has to remain consistent is the tone of the essay writer. And  that can only be consistent if the subject matter is of a fundamentally fixed  nature. Readers have varying tastes but an uneven tone is not ideal for anyone.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sticking  to error free English without losing your fluidity</strong></p>
        <p>None  of us like to read sermons or discourses in general. The descriptive essay  should not read like a prayer address. It should fundamentally be of a positive  outgoing nature. It should read as if you have discovered a new wonder of the  world.</p>
        <p>In the middle of this balancing grammar seems to lose out. If the tone and  subject matter are of a uniform nature then the tenses and syntax has to be  stable too. A sense of miscommunication builds up to a point where there is a  disliking of all the elements in the academic writing.</p>
        <p><strong>How  the lives of other can come into the picture </strong></p>
        <p>You  have written all that you had to about the topic. There is however one decisive  step that you should take before sharing it with the wide world. Make at least  three persons read it.</p>
         <p>The wealth of detail that we possess in our daily lives is remarkable. We truly  get a sense of that only when we interact with others. Words and images that  eluded us while writing will be gained. A fresh perspective is lent by the  presence of others. It could be anyone-your uncle, your favorite school  teacher, your new friend. The more diverse the ages and life experiences of  these persons, the better will be writing. So be more open minded and flexible  with whom you interact. You never know who might help you write a great essay.</p>
      <p><strong>Essay writing online has never been  better</strong></p>
      <p>A good professional writer is hard to find. It might be so that input you  need for your important college essay is elusive. No good student should be  made to suffer for a lack of options.
