              <h1>Stop worrying and start writing a persuasive  essay </h1>

             <p>The persuasive essay lets the college student reflect his or her social  consciousness side. There are so many events in the world that are a cause for  alarm. A persuasive essay writer may make the difference between another world  war and peace.</p>
      <p><strong>Narrowing  down which topic to pursue</strong></p>
      <p>You  need to narrow down your list of topics of interest. You might be a voracious  consumer of all the socially trending topics but you would still need to impose  a restriction on yourself. Academic writing often demands that you do that. So  decide what will be your main point during the course of the paper writing, the  one point that is essential to get across to others. Only after this is done  can the rest of the persuasive essay be pushed forward.</p>
      <p><strong>The  basic blocks of the essay</strong></p>
      <p>You  need to get done with the persuasive essay within a span of five paragraphs.</p>
      <ul class="bull">
            <li>In the first paragraph write or type  what is your central argument regarding the issue at hand. Briefly touch on the  significance of the larger issue before zeroing in your line of thought.</li>
            <li>From paragraph two to paragraph four  there needs to be an expansion of your central persuasion topic. There needs to  be a consolidation of your point of view with relevant examples and related  points of view.</li>
            <li>Paragraph five will be the final stop in  your essay. You cannot be seen to be still maintaining a persuasive approach in  this section. What matters most is a possible listing of suggestions that can  plausibly change the situation for the better. While a college student is not  regarded a subject expert, he or she should indicate having a mindset for positive  solutions to common issues. The world is often lead forward by the initiatives  proposed by its youth.<br />
            </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Be  open minded enough to reflect contrarian views</strong></p>
            <p>Often you might be so immersed in putting forward  your point that you do not even talk of anyone else. It is essential to back up  your leading argument with what others have said on the same topic. It is great  if you can share a couple of notable critics who broadly agree with what you  are saying.</p>   
        
      <p>What would make this an exemplary academic essay writing though is the  inclusion of some notable writers or public speakers who are differing with  your premise. Not only would it reflect your knowledge of the issue at hand but  it also showcases your originality. </p>
            <p> So many college essays read alike because of a  refusal to look beyond the conventional point of view. They essentially read as  pre-determined because there is no genuine effort to push the envelope. Those  who decide to question the status quo and with justifiable reasons for doing so  will usually be looked upon favorably.</p>
      <p><strong>Mixing up of tones is a welcome change  here</strong></p>
      <p>It is commonly seen by professional writers that college students maintain  the same strident tone throughout the course of their persuasive essays.  Passion is appreciated by everyone especially with regarding to young people.  There needs to be an awareness of knowing how to get across your contention.</p>
       
      <p>An active voice might seem like the de-facto approach in establishing your  point. However a passive voice applied judiciously during the essay could  garner attention. An important impression is registered by the essay evaluator-  this college student knows how to approach the world in its varied dimensions.  An occasional open ended line indicates that the essay writer has some more  thoughts on the topic which if needed can be part of another such persuasive  essay. Which educator wouldn't like to be an encouraging influence on students?</p>
