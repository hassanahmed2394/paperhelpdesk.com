                <ul class="bull">
                <li><strong>See things from the point of view of the college</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The expectations of a college from one of its students basically remain the same i.e. he will continue his graduation meet with success and the importance of the university in facilitating his path to success. You should present yourself as a person who loves learning, has a critical bent of mind and displays passion towards the area of his expertise</p>
                <ul class="bull">

                </ul>
                <p>One of the most common mistakes committed by students is that they push themselves too much by trying too hard to impress. Instead use your creativity to translate the mundane into the extraordinary.</p>
                
                <p>Find a voice and style that suits your age and bears proof of an awareness of yourself and a guiding sense of perspective.</p>

                <li><strong>Ditch the Complex Diction</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your essay does not have to be an example of your sound familiarity with synonyms or an exemplary example of your vocabulary.</p>
                
                <ul class="bull">
                <li><strong>Write about things that ignite your passion</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>An authentic way of thinking which remains true to high standards of quality is what the admission officers are looking out for.</p>
                <ul class="bull">
                <li><strong>Go Through Success Stories</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>One of best ways to know the kind of editing preferred by admission officers is to have a look at the past success stories. This ends up being a learning experience where you are able to craft an admission essay that the person at the other end simply cannot put down.</p>
                <p>It is highly recommended that the essay be read by someone close to you and to ask for their opinion on whether the person as portrayed in the paper is indeed the person who wrote it.</p>
                <ul class="bull">
                <li><strong>Stop the Pretensions</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Students who are disadvantaged do indeed get sympathetic treatment but it in no way should ignite your creativity and make you fictionalize your background. The framing of the topic is of greater importance than the topic itself and you need to present an interesting spin on it. The essay provides the college with a glimpse into your inner workings, how you view things, in essence what makes youâ€¦ well, You.</p>
                <ul class="bull">
                <li><strong>Go Along With The Instructions</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The strategy of proving the college you are applying to that you are what they really want is simply the best way to go.</p>
                <ul class="bull">
                <li><strong>Make Use of the Essay Opportunity</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Use the admission essay as an opportunity to convey to the persons overseeing the admission processes what you wanted them toif you were to have a conversation with them. Try to answer all that is required to satiate the question of - what else do you, the student want the officer to know and is there anything that he or she must be aware of.</p>
                <p>Such personal essays form a significant piece of the larger puzzle and for essays it is imperative that you stay on course and in context.</p>
