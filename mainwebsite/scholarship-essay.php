                <p>A scholarship essay is one of the most important pieces of writing you’ll undertake in your life. It will determine whether you will be able to get into the institute that you had your sights on. The buck stops with us with regard to your future.</p>
                <p><strong>The  Thinking Process</strong></p>
                <p>Just think for a couple of minutes about  your life. We’ve all had memorable and significant experiences that have guided  us. You need to go back to that one memory or experience that affected your  perceptions and has lead you to this point. This will enable you to write your  essay with a definite theme.</p>
                <p><strong> The Layout</strong></p>
                <p>Within five paragraphs you have to talk  about a significant event in your life and how the college can in turn fund you  as you proceed further. </p>
                <ul class="bull">
                  <li>The  first paragraph states the chief argument that you’ll make.</li>
                  <li>You’ll  need to explain yourself further in relation to this contention for three  paragraphs. </li>
                  <li>In  the fifth paragraph you will need to wrap up proceedings by a final summary. This  will form the final piece in the jigsaw puzzle that is you as far as the  evaluator of your essay is concerned. You cannot suddenly come up with a fresh  revelation about yourself in this last passage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Focus  on what is relevant to the topic</strong></p>
                <p>
                  We have a tendency to talk in detail  about us if given the opportunity. A scholarship essay might though initially  make us reticent. You want to treat it with due diligence and not reveal  something irrelevant or embarrassing. Those are worthy guidelines to have but  remember to showcase your human side simultaneously. You can admit your flaws.  None of us are error free, not even the subject experts. But you have to  maintain perspective and write about yourself in a sober manner.</p>
                  
                  
                <p><strong>This  is not a repetition of your resume</strong></p>
                <p>We are inclined to think that in resumes we already gave out multiple,  important details. That is true but that does not mean we regurgitate those  details again in the scholarship essay. A part of that resume will find an echo  in the essay. Talking about all your work experience and other achievements would  be non-confirming as per the requirements of the essay.</p>
                <p><strong>Get  it vetted before you click for submit</strong></p>
                <p>You've managed to explain yourself  within five paragraphs in a way that puts forth a convincing portrait and yet  is not a rambling pitch. Well done. But don't go ahead and pat yourself. You  should get your scholarship essay looked over by relatives and friends. It is  important to get another perspective on oneself. Was I as motivated as I  claimed to be? Was the wisdom earned past the experience as deep as I thought  it to be? These kinds of questions need to be answered and we unfortunately  cannot always be honest with ourselves. We need allies who speak in a voice  that we understand but one that will not be a flattering imitation of us.</p>
                <p><strong>Spelling  and Grammar errors to be ironed out</strong></p>
                <p>  These might seem like minor points of omission. After all the trouble you've  undertaken as an aspirant college student on such a reflective topic you want  some leeway. The college selection committee will be a sympathetic body. But it  would be preferable if one were not reduced to a subject of pity. You will have  to meet their needs as much as you can. Ensure that there are no grammatical or  spelling mistakes. If need be ask the English teacher whom you don't  particularly care for. In such vital stages of life, the most unexpected persons  can prove to be a positive influence for you.</p>
