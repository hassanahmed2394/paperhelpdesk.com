                <h1>What exactly is Project Management?</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="order-form-wrap">
                <p>Project Management is considered to be the sum of activities of the methods, processes, skills, knowledge and experience necessary to achieve the objectives of the project. </p>
                <p>A project may said to be a unique and transient endeavor which is undertaken in order to achieve objectives planned earlier. It may be defined in terms of outcomes, benefits or outputs. A project is designated to be a successful one if it succeeds in achieving the objectives according to the pre-determined criteria of acceptance, budget and timescale.</p>
                <p><strong>Project Management consists of the following core components:</strong></p>
                <ul class="bull">
                <li>Defining the reasons that are necessary for the project.</li>
                <li>Making assessments of the requirements of the project, the specified quality of the various deliverables, the estimated resources as well as the timescales.</li>
                <li>Developing a business case in order to justify the investment.</li>
                <li>To secure corporate funding and agreement.</li>
                <li>Preparing and seeing to it that a project management plan is implemented.</li>
                <li>Provide leadership to the delivery team of the project and motivating it.</li>
                <li>Manage the issues, risks and changes in the project.</li>
                <li>Monitoring the actual progress and comparing it with the estimates of the plan.</li>
                <li>Manage the budget of the project.</li>
                <li>Maintain communications with the stake holders as well as the project organization.</li>
                <li>Providing Management.</li>
                <li>Shut the doors on the project in a controlled manner if required.</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <p><strong>When to Use Project Management?</strong></p>
                <p>Projects may be distinguished from the usual business and require people to work as a whole on a temporary basis and focus on specific objectives of the project. As a result of this, effective teamwork is essential to the successful completion of projects.</p>
                <p>Project management centrally concerns itself with management of discrete packages of work in order to achieve particular objectives. The management of work is dependent on factors of wide variety like:</p>
                <ul class="bull">
                <li>The significance, scale and complexity are obvious factors that the work is concerned with.</li>
                <li>The nature of the particular objectives.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The objectives may find expression as the output, outcome, benefits or objectives that further influence the strategy devised by the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Why is Project Management Used?</strong></p>
                <p>Investments in project management have a number of associated benefits to both the organization that plays host to the project and the people who are involved in delivering the same. It helps in:</p>
                <ul class="bull">
                <li>Providing a better chance of achieving the result that is to be desired.</li>
                <li>Make sure that resources are efficiently and optimally used and finally</li>
                <li>Satisfying the diverse needs of the stakeholders of the project.</li>
                </ul>
