             <p>An expository essay has its aim of explaining a particular topic in a manner that is both straightforward as well as logical. In its essence expository essays make a presentation  balanced detailed with a fair amount of analysis of a particular subject having their basis on facts regardless of the references to the emotions or opinions of the writer.</p>
      <p>A typical example of this variety of an essay provides editing prompts which utilizes words such as define or explain. It's characterized by an absence of an opinion or any arguments favored by the writer himself. But by no means writing and editing such an essay should be considered to be an easy task.</p>
      <p><strong>The Editing Process</strong></p>

            <p>All of the body parts should cover separate points duly supported by examples and facts.</p>
