                 <p>Article analysis or critical evaluation of a journal article is about pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of the ideas put forward in the journal and its content. It is a critical to note on what the author of the a journal has to say about a certain topic. Thus, it is evident from the project descriptions itself that this is a complex piece of work that requires much more than just giving the journal a good read a few times. It is a document that marks the value of the article for other readers with thorough interpretation, description and review. Therefore, a candidate must have  ample time for reviewing the core ideas proposed in the article along with reviewing other documents based on similar concepts and then needs to really think in-depth about aspects like - what the title of the article leads me to expect from the article, the main arguments were properly summarized or not, do the sub-headings clearly state what is described in the successive paragraphs and much more. </p>
                <p>Moreover, in order to critically analyze an article one must also do some background researches about the author, learn the basics of e-indexing, and determine if the material is appropriate for the intended audience, also gauge if the article is chronologically correct in terms of stating the theories and more importantly if the article lacks in any important facts about the subject or topic at hand. </p>
                
                <p>Thus, to articulate it better, an analyst must be very well aware of the facts and the recent developments in the field of study and must invest a huge amount of time. And today's scholars have anything but time, as we like to call it - today's students are time poor, hence, it is expected that they will need some help for analyzing the article. </p>
